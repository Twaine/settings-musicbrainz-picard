We use this file for storing our TODOs instead of the Github bugtracker because there seems to be no official way to export the issues there.
We don't want to rely upon Github as a single point of failure.

Non-critical TODOs:
- I decided to set "Replace non-ASCII characters: Disabled.", see the actual settings for an explanation why. Nevertheless, we should check what happens when copying files which contain Unicode characters to standard USB-stick/MP3-player/Android-USB-disk filesystems (VFAT, exFAT, etc). If the KDE file copying tools which we use are not suitable for that transition, we might reconsider the replacement setting.
